# LoginTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Purpose
1. Build a test application for authentication/authorization testing using JWT
2. Build a test application that has full fledged REST calls for all server resources
3. Build a client side mimic of a server that intercepts all calls eliminating any need for a "real" server

## TODO
1. ~~logout the user~~ **DONE**
2. build out the real JWT process
    * include Authorization header in every secure request
3. better (okay, more than zero) style
4. validate that you can't delete yourself
